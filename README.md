## The task
During a vivid dream last night, your future employer came to you and gave you this dataset:

[Data about ad buys in different media markets and overall sales](Company_ad_buys_and_sales.csv)

The data represents data about the various ad spends on TV, radio, and newspaper for your boss' competitors.  Your boss wants to understand the data better and has asked you to do a regression analysis for each of the three media types.

Pick one of the media types and model its relationship to sales. 

Start with a linear regression, plot the line and calculate the r-squared value.  Try some polynomial regression and see if you can get an optimal r-squared value.
